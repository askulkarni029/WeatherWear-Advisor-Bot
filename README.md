# 🌤️ WeatherWear Advisor Bot -
Smart Weather-Based Clothing Recommendation Automation using UiPath


# 📌 Project Overview -

WeatherWear Advisor Bot is an intelligent RPA solution built using UiPath that automatically fetches the live weather of any city and recommends the most suitable clothing for the user. The bot simulates a real-world decision-making scenario by combining web scraping, rule-based logic, and data processing to deliver personalized recommendations.

The user simply enters a city name → the bot fetches the weather from Google → processes the temperature → and suggests relevant attire based on predefined logic.

This project demonstrates practical automation skills including UI interaction, selectors, data extraction, workflow design, decision-making, and exception handling.
